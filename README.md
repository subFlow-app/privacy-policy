# Privacy Policy

Thank you for using the SubFlow app. By using this app, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.

## Requested Permissions
SubFlow requires the following permissions:
- **Notifications**: To remind you of upcoming subscription renewals in advance. Notifications are used exclusively for this purpose.
- **Biometrics (Face ID/Touch ID)**: If you choose to use the app lock, SubFlow may ask for permission to unlock the app using Face ID or Touch ID. The app uses the LocalAuthentication framework (available for supported devices) to authenticate with biometrics, but does not have access to your biometric data, which is stored on the device and managed by the operating system. These permissions are not used for any other purpose.

## Data Collection and Storage
SubFlow does not collect any personal data from users and does not display advertisements.
- **Purchase Verification**: SubFlow may communicate with Apple servers or other payment services to verify your purchase.
- **iCloud Backup**: Data is stored in a private CloudKit container and the developer does not have access to this data.

## Data Security
SubFlow implements security measures to ensure the protection of data stored in the app and associated services, such as iCloud. However, we recommend that users keep their device security settings up to date for added protection.

## Your Rights
You have the right to control how your information is stored and used. You can manage notification permissions at any time through the app settings.

## Changes to this Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will inform users of important changes through in-app notifications or other appropriate means.
